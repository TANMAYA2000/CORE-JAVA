**CLASS NOTES**
# CLASS

1. Class generates an Object

2. 'New' keyword sends request to the class so that class can generate object

3. Class is a template for object

4. It is a blueprint for creating object

         #Always remember name of class should be match with filename otherwise code will not execute

```java
public class A {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    A a1 = new A();
    System.out.println("a1");
  }
}
```
# NEW KEYWORD
   
1.'new' keyword sends request to the class to create object

2.once object is created 'new' keyword will get object address which stores that in refrence variabels


# GARBAGE COLLECTOR
   
  1. Garbage collector keeps removing objects from the ram on regular basis thus avoiding overflow of memory
   
   2.  ....this makes the meomry management efficient.....
   
# OBJECT
   
   1.Object is a instance of a class
   
   2.It is a real world entity that has an identity behaviour_
