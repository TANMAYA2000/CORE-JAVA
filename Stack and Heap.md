# STACK
- Stack maintains program execution flow and it maintains LIFO (LAST IN FORST OUT).
- Code as it is loaded in stack memory.
- New obeject created in _Heap memory_.
- Once the execution is done code popped out from stack memory.
- Then object created in heap is unused object.

  
  **NOTE**

  
  1. An object whose address is not there in stack are the **_unused object_**.
  2. Garbage collector removes unused objects from HEAP (RAM).
  3. **All objects are created in heap memory.**

     # METASPACE

     - Basically metaspace is a location in Stack where static and non-static variables both are saved
    


       
##**this was introduced in java 8**
